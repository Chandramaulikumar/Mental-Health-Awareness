    <h3>What is Mental Health?</h3>

   
    <p>Mental Health is every human's psychological, emotional well-being. It affects how we think, the actions we do
        based on behaviour, and how we feel emotions.</p>
    <p>Our Mental Health affects different aspects of our lives every day, for instance, the way we communicate with
        others or how we react to certain situations that may arise. How do you know you have a healthy mind? Being
        mentally stable and able to manage your emotions, having the ability to be optimistic, validating your feelings
        and allowing yourself to feel negative and positive emotions, and maintaining your social relationships with
        others and yourself are some of the various characteristics of a healthy mind. With a healthy mind we can attain
        the goal of a healthy body that will work together and function to their maximum capacity leaving us feeling
        renewed.</p>

    <h3>How has Covid-19 affected Mental Health?</h3>
    <p>Covid-19 has damaged many aspects of our society and in relation to Mental Health, it is no different. Since the
        Covid-19 Pandemic started people have been filled with anxiety, stress, and sadness; these emotions are let out
        by everyone in multiple ways unique to a person. In some instances, these negative emotions are just too
        overwhelming for us to handle and our mind can short circuit and cause our body to react differently than it
        used to. Research has shown that 4 in 10 adults have reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder. These
        symptoms can include fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of interest in certain activities and more.
        Studies also show that other than anxiety and depressive disorders, substance use and consumption has increased
        by 12%, indicating to us that people are turning to alcohol and other drugs to get rid of these overwhelming
        emotions that are just too much for their mind to handle. Research tells us Covid-19 can also affect the mental
        health of specific age groups or genders more than others, in this case, it is said that women are having higher
        rates of anxiety and depression than men.

    <h3>How has Covid-19 affected Mental Health in Belize?</h3>
    <p>In the country of Belize, there are Mental Health services that can be provided but only to a certain extent, the
        topic overall isn’t really talked about one on one in our communities. As a result of little awareness, Mental
        Health is often discriminated against by most adults and especially by younger age groups. Luckily, UNICEF has
        touched on some statistics of Mental Health in the Caribbean which counts Belize in, and due to this some people
        are aware of what it is. Without realizing it, adults in Belize show symptoms of Mental Health issues every day.
        Many students are now forced to turn to virtual learning which takes a toll on their minds since everything is
        so new. Students in my High School always share how stressed and anxious they are of what will happen next with
        the pandemic or if they’ll be able to fully adjust to the workload and rules of online learning. Primary School
        Students aren’t all equipped with the materials they need for online learning and so they must do the work
        physically in packages with no guidance from a teacher, leaving parents to teach their kids. Most parents are
        already stressed and worried how they will pay bills since most prices increased or because they have lost their
        jobs, and now they must try their best to educate their children in curriculums they know nothing about. All of
        these situations cause severe symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, yet Mental Health is still
        stigmatized in Belize. The Ministry of Health in Belize had to release an official announcement about how
        Covid-19 patients should not be discriminated against just because they were tested positive; these patients
        were unfortunately being harassed with ignorant and degrading comments from others which caused them to feel
        emotionally trapped and fearful as to why they were receiving such attention.
